Welcome to ROS Embodied AI Community Group! Please refer to our [living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GMWQins1LQjFvlmVgsAxAr0-5mtHv4RCLoJpv1xP3MM/edit?usp=sharing) for **meeting link**, notes, planning and agenda.

## Goal

The group unites the open source community developing Generative AI frameworks, tools and applications for ROS ecosystem. It serves to
align developments and as a platform to share experiences with novel technology, learning from other projects and applications, and collaborating towards common goals, new features, and integrations. We are also looking forward towards standarization efforts as the technology and projects mature.

## Group lead

Adam Dabrowski (Robotec.ai), adam.dabrowski@robotec.ai, GitHub handle @adamdbrw.

## Background

Large Language Models, Vision Language Models and AI Agent architectures are recent breakthrough technologies that most of you are familiar with. There are many gaps in Generative AI for robotics such as in spatial and temporal reasoning, dealing with imperfect perception and actuation, performance, size, liability, and so on. However, there are also important strengths and applications that are already quite reasonable, such as in human-robot interaction, high-level planning, inspections, lowering the skill gap of robot use, and diagnostics.

## Projects

So far, the following project leads expressed interest in participating: 
- [RAI](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai)
- [ROSA](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa)
- [ros2ai](https://github.com/fujitatomoya/ros2ai)
- [Llama ROS](https://github.com/mgonzs13/llama_ros)

## Additional community resources

Some of the projects in the space were presented at ROSCon 2024, the AI section starts with [RAI presentation](https://vimeo.com/1022195000#t=8h20m16s) and continues with ros2ai.
